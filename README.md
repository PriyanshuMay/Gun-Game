# My Experiments With Competitive Programming


## Why

I'm about to start the third year of my graduation and still, I haven't focused on my data structures, programming fundamentals, algorithms, competitive programming, etc:cry:. In these past two years, I have given only 1 contest on leetcode , 9-10 on codeforces and 11-12 on codechef.
So, I'm creating this repo/blog/website in the hope to get regular at cp and strengthen my dsa.
I will be trying out this domain for the next 10-12 months. So let's see how this experiment goes :crossed_fingers:
